                Hello! I'm excited to share a little about myself with you. I am a recent graduate and I majored in Business Administration at Pepperdin University located in Malibu, CA. During my senior year, I had a change of heart and decided to learn how to code. Since August of 2022, I've been learning how to code using the free online curriculum called The Odin Project. Overall I have found this experience to be incredibly rewarding while also a very challenging experience. 
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                What drew me to coding was the possibility of being able to create anything I wanted. The ability to bring an idea to life and see it come to fruition is incredibly empowering. I love the challenge of problem-solving and finding new ways to approach a project. The satisfaction of seeing a project through from start to finish is something I find truly fulfilling. <br>
            </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
                While I'm still new to coding, I'm excited to continue learning and honing my skills. I believe that coding is a field that is constantly evolving, and there will always be new challenges and opportunities to learn. Overall I'm very excited to see where this journey takes me and am eager to continue exploring the vast possibilities that coding has to offer.
